## Tips & Best Practices - ReactiveUI

### Inject Service Locator interface via constructor

```
public SuspensionHost(ISuspensionDriver driver = null)
{
    driver = driver ?? Locator.Current.GetService<ISuspensionDriver>();
}
```

**Explanation:** This uses a Service Located interface for the default interface, but only if the caller didn't give an explicit one in the constructor. Far more straightforward to test in a unit test runner than trying to construct a sham IoC container, but still falls back to a default implementation at runtime.

### Call async operations in the View constructor, rather than the ViewModel constructor.

```
this.WhenAnyValue(x => x.ViewModel.LoadItems)
    .SelectMany(x => x.ExecuteAsync())
    .Subscribe();
```

**Explanation:** Invoking async operations in the ViewModel constructor means that your ViewModel class becomes more difficult to test, because you always have to mock out the effects of calling LoadItems, even if the thing you are testing is unrelated.

## ReactiveUI Glossary

**RoutedViewHost:**

**WhenActivated:** allows you to specify the things that should occur when a view or view model is activated and deactivated; requries that our view implements IActivatable; Typically, you don't need to worry about disposing of the disposable returned by WhenActivated. Views tend to deactivate naturally as a consequence of users navigating through your application and ReactiveUI's default IActivationForViewFetcher implementations.

**IActivatable:** think of it as IActivatableView; implemented by IViewFor; tag interface (no methods to implement)

**ISupportsActivation:** think of it as IActivatableViewModel; requires that the IViewFor invokes WhenActivated; can test view model activation and deactivation by calling Activate and Deactivate; implementing this interface more than once in a view model class hierarchy will result in view model activation failing to work correctly

**ViewModelActivator:** essentially a sink in which WhenActivated will register the blocks of activation logic provided by your view model

**IActivationForViewFetcher:** implements GetAffinityForView and GetActivationForView

**GetAffinityForView:** method of IActivationForViewFetcher; tells ReactiveUI how confident you are that your implementation of IActivationForViewFetcher can provide activation information for a given view; higher numbers returned by this method trump lower numbers returned by other implementations

**GetActivationForView:** method of IActivationForViewFetcher; returns IObservable<bool> that ticks true when the view is activated and false when the view is deactivated
